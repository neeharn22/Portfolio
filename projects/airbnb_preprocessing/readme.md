# Summary

The initial Western Australia data set contained 10485 rows x 75 columns. Through pre-processing, the data set has been cleansed and reduced to 8398 rows x 26 columns. The same has been achieved by reducing data dimensionality, excluding the missing values, addressing all N/As in the data set, smoothening the outliers (transformations), which will have an impact on determining the target variable, and lastly addressing outliers, if any (through Mahalanobis / Multivariate, etc.) . Now, the data set is to be modeled and run through the partitions to test on the test data.
