# Executive Summary:

The dataset contains YouTube comments on Oscar-nominated movie trailers for 4 select few 
movies: “Dunkirk”, “The Shape of Water”, “Phantom Thread”, and "Get Out". Text-mining can be 
explored to understand the kind of sentiment that flows amongst the audience for a particular movie, the 
kind of comments, frequently used words, reactions (likes / dislikes), etc. for these movies.

## Business context:

By understanding the sentiments and trend patterns around movie trailers, social media platforms like 
YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, etc. can help movie industry prioritize content building and 
sequencing of the most trending to least trending movies generating high CTR (Click through rates), 
converting more users to watch the content, etc. and hence generating revenue sources through 
advertisements, renting, and buying movies, etc.

## Model overview:

The study showcases a text mining learning exercise to understand trends and patterns through movie 
trailer reviews. The dataset originally contained 5 columns. To extract information from the dataset, we 
have added one more column “Movie name” to create separate clusters for each of the 4 movies. 
The analysis was split into 2 parts:
1. Analyzing how the reviews trend and what are the key topics for all the movies together 
2. Individually understand the key topics discussed and sentiments that follow watching the movie 
trailers

We found out that people gravitate towards war and action movies, such as movie named “Dunkirk”.
Secondly, people tend to reflect negatively on topics which are sensitive and attract a lot of flak amongst 
viewers if not portrayed well, for example the topic of racism. Lastly, actors and actresses can overpower 
the fame a movie receives, and influences viewership driven by crazy fan-base to a very large extent. 
For instance, in the movie “Phantom Thread”, the famous actor Daniel Day Lewis portrayed the role of
Reynolds Woodcock and was very well received by the audience as will be seen in the analysis.
In conclusion, people like war and history genres. YouTube and other media platforms can look at 
creating content along those lines. Also, a huge part of viewership depends on the actors / actresses
casted. This effectively drives revenue generation. Highly acclaimed actors earn higher viewership and 
hence increase revenue generation. And lastly, the degree of viewership tends to increase as there are 
events like nomination announcements, trailer launches, etc. Doing events around those time frames can 
help drive revenue generation due to higher CTR and viewership.
