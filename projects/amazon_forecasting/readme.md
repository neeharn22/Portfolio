# Summary

In conclusion, the best model was the ARIMAX(2,0) model. It has a mean absolute percentage error of 2.22%, an AIC of 210334.4, and an SBC of 210391.5. The best model had the best MAPE of all the other models therefore the AIC and SBC were not considered, as these are based on fit statistics or training data. 

Moreover, the forecast shows a drop in sales in the forward time horizon following the trend depicted in fit data. 

Finally, the business recommendations that yield from this analysis are as follows:

* Firstly, given that the macroeconomic indicators show a positive trend, the forecast shows a decline in 
sales and hence factors leading to the drop should be investigated. 
* Secondly, department level sales trends can be understood to find critical focus areas. 
* Finally, other indicators like quality, delivery of service, price points can be evaluated to understand if 
there are other factors influencing the sales
