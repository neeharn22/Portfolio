Our investment project focuses on exploring Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) and momentum trading (MT) within the realm of finance. Our objective is to develop investment strategies that effectively balance maximizing returns while managing risk. Through rigorous data analysis and strategic decision-making, we aim to navigate the complexities of financial markets to identify optimal portfolio allocations.

The project unfolds in several stages, each aimed at providing a comprehensive understanding of MPT and MT. Initially, we begin with data preparation, meticulously selecting and cleaning a curated set of stocks across various sectors. Real-world data is cleaned and preprocessed to ensure reliability and relevance to our analysis.

Subsequently, we delve into momentum trading, a strategy centered around identifying market trends and exploiting momentum dynamics. Utilizing moving averages and historical price data, we aim to identify top-performing stocks within each sector. Through visualizations and performance metrics, we assess the effectiveness of the 8-21 Momentum Trading Strategy.

Concurrently, we embrace the principles of Modern Portfolio Theory, which revolutionized risk-return conceptualization in investment theory. By constructing efficient portfolios tailored to varying risk tolerances, we showcase the diverse range of investment opportunities within our selected stocks. Through optimization techniques and rigorous analysis, we seek to determine optimal asset allocations maximizing returns while minimizing risk.

In the final stage, we transition from theory to practical application, evaluating investment strategy performance using real-world data from 2022. By comparing outcomes of buy-and-hold strategies, momentum trading on the S&P 500 index, and MPT portfolios, we aim to identify the most favorable approach.

Join us in this journey through financial markets, where data-driven insights and strategic thinking converge to unlock investment opportunities. Through meticulous analysis and critical assessment, we aim to equip ourselves with the knowledge and skills necessary to thrive in finance's ever-evolving landscape.

**Investment Strategy Evaluation**

Upon analyzing the outcomes from 'MPT Portfolio Buy and Hold', 'GSPC MT', and 'GSPC Buy and Hold', notable insights surfaced. By investing $100,000, the returns from the three different methods of investment are summarized as below.

        *  MPT Portfolio Buy and Hold - $63,746.66
